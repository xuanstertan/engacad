        <h3>T-Shirt Design</h3>
      </section>
      <div class="docum">
        <p>This is the last part of activity we were tasked to do for the 2 day EA-Hands don session. In short, we were given a plain white polyester T-shirt and we had to design it using our own creativity.</p>

      <div class="front">
        <p>To start off, the Engineering Academy (EA) logo on the front of the T-shirt was standadized for everyone. So some of you might wonder how did I manage to print the logo on the shirt? Well, the method which I had used to print my shirt is known as dye sublimation.</p><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>First up, I had to use the heat press machine to heat press my shirt for 5 seconds to prevent any shrinkages. Next, I had to use the paper cutter to trim off the excess portion of the EA logo sublimation paper. After which, I position the logo such that it is 4 iches from the collar and 4.5 inches from the sides of the shirt. Finally, I use tape to secure the sublimation paper and heat press the shirt for 45 seconds.</p><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>As for my name below the EA logo, the process is similar. Firstly, I had to position my name directly in the centre of the EA logo. After which, I applied tape to the ends of the sublimation paper so as to secure it. last but not least, heat press for a good 45 seconds and my T-shirt printing is complete.</p>

      <div class="back">
        <p>As for the design at the back of the T-shirt, I made use of the website known as canva.com to design it. After considering hard for a long time, I decided to go with word art as my design. Initially, I thought to myself that since I am in EA, why not make use of positive words to potray how an EA student behaves like. So this was how my design came about. After finished with the desiging, we had to save our design into SVG format and afterwards export it into a thumb drive / SD card.</p>
