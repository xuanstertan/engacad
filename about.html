      <p>Hello there, I am Tan Yi Xuan, a Singapore Poly student from the school of MAE. At the moment, I am a year 1 student from the diploma in Aeronautical Engineering Course (DARE). I am currently about to embark on my second year in SP and hoping to maintain my good GPA record till the end of year 3. Something interesting about me is that I do not prefer playing games. Can talk more about my CCA.</p>

      <p>My hobbies are that I enjoy playing sports during my free time. I pick up the passion of sport ever since I was 6 years old. Sports to me is like everything in my life and without it, I might not be able to live on. I love to play many different kind of sports, ranging from basketball, soccer,cycling,swimming, running, volleyball, table tennis, badminton. Often after a long period of studying, I will catch a break by playing sports to relieve stress. Some of the common sports which I play often are basketball, cycling, swimming, running and table tennis.</p>

      <h2>Why did I join EA?</h2>
    </section>
    <div class="lol3">
      <p>One of the main reason why I wanted to join EA is because I wanted to step out of my comfort zone and take up the challenge of trying out something new since I rarely this kind of opportunities. I personally feel that joining EA, one does not only get to know more about engineering but also learn how to document their own work which is what I am currently doing now. Through EA, I hope to enhance new skills and deepen my enginnering proficiency so as to be prepared for the working world. I know that joining the EA route definitely would not be so easy and smooth going, however, I am willing to persevere till the very end.</p>
