        <p>In the morning on the first day of our EA Hands-on-session, we were taught how to use HTML and CSS to design our own website.
           However, in the afternoon after lunch, we were taught how to use Fusion 360 and the 3D printers to make our own name tag 
           keychain with our name crafted on it.</p>
        <p>To be very honest, my knowledge of inventor wasn't really that strong in year 1 sem . 
          Since Fusion 360 was somewhat similar to inventor, I had difficulty catching up with what Mr Steven was covering 
          was I was quite unfamiliar with the various commands used. But at the end of the day, I did manage to complete designing my 
          nametag and learnt quite a fai bit too.</p>

      <div class="exp2">
        <p>This is the model of the name tag</p>
      </div>
      <div class="exp3">
        <p>After I had completed designing the name tag, i saved the file as STL format and imported it to Ultimaker Cura,
           a software used for 3D printing. I did some changes to the postion and settings of the nametag and once done, 
           I click on the slice buttton on the bottom right of the screen and saved the file for 3D printing.</p>
